# Experimentation with different hues and saturation.

Painting/Art: I feel the brown colour palette suits my icon the best. Since there's already a combination of different paints, if there was more colours using the same hue appeared will make it look confusing and unattractive. Therefore by use a brownish colour as the bottom colour (palette), creates a contrast with the paint, allowing it to look more neat.

Singing/Karaoke: For this design, I used three different saturations from one hue (grey). My final decision is to use the bottom right, since the combination of the colurs makes the overall look analogous.

Music: The middle colour has the best combination since it is monochromatic, creating a soothing and aesthetic effect. Furthermore, since the colour choices for this design is very limited, so I decided to make the colour combination simple, all from one hue.

Piano: I'm deciding to use the bottom left colour design since it is also a minichromatic colour combination, made from the same hue. This creates a soft and harmonious effect, making it visually appealling.

Video/Reels: I'm deciding to use the bottom left colour combination as my icon design. This is because the they're both complementary colours, creating a strong contrast. Despite their contrast, I've adjusted the saturation and brightness of the colours, creating a harmonious and pleasing visual effect.
