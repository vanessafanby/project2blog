# Process
Since we were only allowed to use squares, I experimented by changing directions and the size. As an example, when a diamond overlays squares, portrays different feelings. To add on, larger shapes thats takes up more space gives the audience a sense of boldness and tension. Whilst neat shapes portays a tidy and order feeling.
