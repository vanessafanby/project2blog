# Thumbnail sketch activity

This is thumbnail sketch related to laughter. I feel number 3 and 20 is the most effective since it is a wellknown expression for 'laughing', therefore the audience is able to instantly know what I'm trying to portray. 

# My sketches for the 'COMMUNITY' icon. 


## Art/Painting

The first icon that I sketched is a colour palette, linked to painting and artwork. When a person sees a colour palette, the first thing that appears in their mind is playful and artistic. This links to the gaming activies that people are able to play on the app. 


## Comment

The comment icon is related to a 'speech bubble'. I decided to use that design since it is a familiar shape, making it recognisable as a symbol for posting comments. (still deciding to use the top one or the bottom one)


## Singing

Since a microphone is a wellknown symbol for singing and voice-based activities, I decided to use this to allow users to recognise that the icon is related to singing and karaoke.


## Music

I decided to use headphones to represent music instead of music notes since it is more easily identifiable. The unique design of earcups and headband, provides a simple and recognizable shape. Furthermore, I've also decided to add an icon for music instrument activities, not making the icon into music notes is to avoid the audience getting mixed up with the icons. 


## Photo/Image

I used sun and mountain as my symbolic icon since it evokes a beautiful scenery, establishing a representation of photos. This allows the user to recognise this icon as interactive, able to share scenery, and their surroundings that they find appealing. 


![rough_sketch](/static/W4/piano.jpeg)
I found that the bottom right corner is the best sketch to represent music/piano games. Comparing with the plain and simple piano keys, outlining the shape of piano seems to be more engaging. 


![rough_sketch](/static/W4/post.jpeg)
I was struggling with choosing which design suits the best. The top right one looks good but the user might be confused if the icon is used to post or send an email, and the circled ones just seems to be too simple. Therefore, I chose between the bottom right two. 


![rough_sketch](/static/W4/profile.jpeg)
I'm planning on combining the right two designs, experimenting it using illustrator. I feel the male and female icon seems to be the best, however I struggled with making into a flat design on iillustor. Therefore, I just decided to make the icon simple as it could be (outline of a person). 


![rough_sketch](/static/W4/video.jpeg)
The video symbol that I decided to use is wellknown and familiarised, allowing the user to know what the icon directs them to. I decided to add some buttons on the top to represent a change of channel, and the opening and closing button.
