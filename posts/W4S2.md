# Thumbnail sketch activity

This is thumbnail sketch related to laughter. I feel number 3 and 20 is the most effective since it is a wellknown expression for 'laughing', therefore the audience is able to instantly know what I'm trying to portray. 

# My sketches for the 'COMMUNITY' icon. 


## Art/Painting

The first icon that I sketched is a colour palette, linked to painting and artwork. When a person sees a colour palette, the first thing that appears in their mind is playful and artistic. This links to the gaming activies that people are able to play on the app. 


## Comment

The comment icon is related to a 'speech bubble'. I decided to use that design since it is a familiar shape, making it recognisable as a symbol for posting comments. (still deciding to use the top one or the bottom one)


## Singing

Since a microphone is a wellknown symbol for singing and voice-based activities, I decided to use this to allow users to recognise that the icon is related to singing and karaoke.


## Music

I decided to use headphones to represent music instead of music notes since it is more easily identifiable. The unique design of earcups and headband, provides a simple and recognizable shape. Furthermore, I've also decided to add an icon for music instrument activities, not making the icon into music notes is to avoid the audience getting mixed up with the icons.
