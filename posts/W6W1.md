# Sounds using Abobe Audition 
![sound](/static/W6/Sound.jpeg)
I recorded nine sounds using the 'recording' app on the phone and uploaded them on Adobe Audition. First of all, I chose the snippet that I wanted to use as my soundtrack. Secondly, I cropped off the excess sounds and adjusted the fade in fade out levels. Finally, I went to 'Effects', 'Amplitude and Compression', and 'Normalised' the process to 100 percent. Moved the 9 sounds to the 'Batch Process' and clicked 'run' to save it in my folder.

Since I wasn't able to use the sound template. I used a new system, called 'Buzz', different from the ones taught in class (had some trouble working with it)

Downloaded buzz and dragged the 'buzz.js' template in 'MyWebsite' folder.
