# Experimentation

I navigated throught the different icons that I could use. For some icons, I overlaped them on top of each other or flipped them to the opposite direction. I also tried to make some new shapes from the original icons. As an example, for the piano icon, I tried to make it look like a shoe. Furthermore for the video icon, I tried to make it look like a face.

This is what my icons look when they're finished.

I found swapping the image and adding the soundtrack difficult. I followed the steps on the powerpoint in order to swap the icons successfully. However, inserting the soundtrack was a big challenge.
